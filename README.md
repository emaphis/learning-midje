learning-midje
==============

This repository is for my learning midje.  I'm basically following along with the documentation on the [midje wiki](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki). I will add more experiments as I continue to learn midje, so this repository make become a usefull repository of midje knowledge presented as executable midge code.


Check out Jay Fields essay on learning a language or library using [Unit testing](http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/08/clojuretest-introduction.html).

Also check out Mike Clark's [blog](http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2005/3/18/ruby-learning-test-1-are-you-there-world).

Ironically enough, Jay Fields is the author of [clojure expectations](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki) a different clojure unit testing frame work.
